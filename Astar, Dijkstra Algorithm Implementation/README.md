# RBE 550 - Basic Search Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

In this assignment, you are going to implement **Dijkstra** and **A*** algorithms with Python 3. This template is provided to you as a starting point. After you finish coding, you would be able to create your own map to test different algorithms, and visualize the path found by them.

Files included:

- **search.py** is the file where you will implement your algorithms. Please do not change the existing functions names, as we will use a grader code to help us grade your assignments more efficiently. 
- **main.py** is the script that provides helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path. You are not required to modify anything but you are encouraged to read and understand the code.
- **map.csv** is the map file you could modify to create your own map.
- **test_map.csv** restores a test map for doc test purpose only. Do not modify this file.
